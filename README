This project provides trace read and write libraries, as well as a trace
converter. A plugin can be created for any trace format to allow its conversion
to/from another trace format.


* For Developers

This source tree is based on the autotools suite from GNU to simplify
portability. Here are some things you should have on your system in order to
compile the git repository tree :

- GNU autotools (automake >=1.7, autoconf >=2.50, autoheader >=2.50)
  (make sure your system wide "automake" points to a recent version!)
- GNU Libtool
  (for more information, go to http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)

If you get the tree from the repository, you will need to use the "bootstrap"
script in the root of the tree. It calls all the GNU tools needed to prepare the
tree configuration.
