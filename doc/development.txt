This document describes some principles that should be respected when
developing in Babeltrace.

Memory usage :
Since Babeltrace exports a library, we need to make sure that all allocated
memory is freed, we do not want any memory leaks.
Since Babeltrace uses the glib, it is necessary to assist a little valgrind
when trying to identify memory leaks.
So the proper invocation of Babeltrace with Valgrind is :
G_SLICE=always-malloc G_DEBUG=gc-friendly valgrind --leak-check=full babeltrace
